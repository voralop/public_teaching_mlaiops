"""Azure adapter. Implement upload/download/push_image for Lab 1.

SDK:  pip install azure-storage-blob azure-identity azure-containerregistry
Docs: BlobServiceClient for storage; ACR push goes through `docker push` after
      `az acr login --name <registry>`.

Hints for Lab 1:
  * BLOB_URI is either abfss://container@account.dfs.core.windows.net/prefix or
    https://account.blob.core.windows.net/container/prefix. Pick one form and parse
    it here, never in src/.
  * Use DefaultAzureCredential rather than a connection string. It picks up your CLI
    login locally and your managed identity in CI, which is what Lab 4 needs.
  * push_image must return the digest reference: registry.azurecr.io/repo@sha256:...
  * Azure tags live on the resource, not the blob. Tag the storage account, the
    registry, and later the workspace with cfg.tags(1).
