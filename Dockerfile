# ITCS355 Lab 1 — training image
#
# TODO(Lab 1, Task 2): pin this base image BY DIGEST, not by tag.
#   Tags move. `python:3.11-slim` today is not `python:3.11-slim` next month, and a
#   moving base is the commonest reason a "reproducible" build stops reproducing.
#   Get the digest with:
#       docker pull python:3.11-slim && docker inspect --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}' python:3.11-slim
#   Then replace the two FROM lines below with the digest form:
#       FROM python@sha256:<digest> AS builder
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder
